< ProjectQ comes with a high-performance quantum simulator written in C++. Please see the detailed OS specific installation instructions below to make sure that you are installing the fastest version.

< 	In order to install the fast C++ simulator, we require that your system has a C++ compiler (see option 3 below on how to only install the slower Python simulator via the `--without-cppsimulator` parameter)
< 
< 	Below you will find two options to install the fast C++ simulator. The first one is the easiest and requires only the standard compiler which Apple distributes with XCode. The second option uses macports to install the simulator with additional support for multi-threading by using OpenMP, which makes it slightly faster. We show how to install the required C++ compiler (clang) which supports OpenMP and additionally, we show how to install a newer python version.
< 
< .. note::
< 	Depending on your system you might need to use `sudo` for the installation.
< 
< 1. Installation using XCode and the default python:
< 
< 	Install XCode by opening a terminal and running the following command:

< 	Next, you will need to install Python and pip. See option 2 for information on how to install a newer python version with macports. Here, we are using the standard python which is preinstalled with macOS. Pip can be installed by:
< 
< 	.. code-block:: bash
< 
< 		sudo easy_install pip
< 
< 	Now, you can install ProjectQ with the C++ simulator using the standard command:
< 
< 	.. code-block:: bash
< 
< 		python -m pip install --user projectq
< 
< 
< 2. Installation using macports:
< 
< 	Either use the standard python and install pip as shown in option 1 or better use macports to install a newer python version, e.g., Python 3.5 and the corresponding pip. Visit `macports.org <https://www.macports.org/install.php>`_ and install the latest version (afterwards open a new terminal). Then, use macports to install Python 3.5 by

< 	Next, we can install ProjectQ with the high performance simulator written in C++. First, we will need to install a suitable compiler with support for **C++11**, OpenMP, and instrinsics. The best option is to install clang 3.9 also using macports (note: gcc installed via macports does not work)

One option is to install clang 3.9 also using macports (note: gcc installed via macports does not work as the gcc compiler claims to support instrinsics, while the assembler of gcc does not support it)

< 3. Installation with only the slow Python simulator:
< 
< 	While this simulator works fine for small examples, it is suggested to install the high performance simulator written in C++.
---
> 	If you don't want to install clang 3.9, you can try and specify your preferred compiler by changing CC and CXX in the above command (the compiler must support **C++11**).
