< 
< Floyd-Warshall algorithm implementation.
< 
< Calculates the length of the shortest path connecting every ordered pair of nodes in a directed graph.
< 
< 
< 
< Input:
<     n: The number of nodes in the graph. The nodes are assumed to have ids 0..n-1
<     length_by_edge: A dict containing edge length keyed by an ordered pair of node ids
< 
< Precondition:
<     There are no negative-length cycles in the input graph
< 
< Output:
<     A dict containing shortest path length keyed by an ordered pair of node ids
