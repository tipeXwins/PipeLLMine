< Infix to RPN Conversion
< shunting-yard
< 
< 
< Uses Dijkstra's shunting-yard algorithm to transform infix notation into equivalent Reverse Polish Notation.
< 
< Input:
<     tokens: A list of tokens in infix notation
< 
< Precondition:
<     all(isinstance(token, int) or token in '+-*/' for token in tokens)
< 
< Output:
<     The input tokens reordered into Reverse Polish Notation
< 
< Examples:
<     >>> shunting_yard([10, '-', 5, '-', 2])
<     [10, 5, '-', 2, '-']
<     >>> shunting_yard([34, '-', 12, '/', 5])
<     [34, 12, 5, '/' ,'-']
<     >>> shunting_yard([4, '+', 9, '*', 9, '-', 10, '+', 13])
<     [4, 9, 9, '*', '+', 10, '-', 13, '+']
